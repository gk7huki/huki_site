## Re-Volt

![Re-Volt](/assets/re-volt.jpg)

As an active member of the [Re-Volt] fan community, I launched and handled several projects aimed at tweaking / improving the game, bringing it to new platforms and connecting players together. The RVGL project aims to bring the game to more platforms than ever before, and has found coverage in several gaming magazines including the ODROID magazine ([April 2016 issue](http://magazine.odroid.com/201604)) and [Kotaku].

## Code::Blocks

I was involved in improving the C/C++ code parsing and code completion support in this great IDE, along with various usability fixes. I work with the C::B team to discuss these changes and get them merged upstream. I also maintain my own fork with more experimental changes.
