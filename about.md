I'm known for my [Re-Volt] patches that I developed together with [jigebren], and more recently the [RVGL] cross-platform port. The game has a very dedicated fan following and an active portal at [Re-Volt IO]. If you're looking for something fun to play with friends or family, I really recommend giving RVGL a spin.

Apart from video games, I enjoy using and contributing to Free Software. My main systems are Xubuntu and Arch Linux, and the desktop environment of my choice is XFCE (I still prefer a traditional desktop). Free Software is able to fulfil all my computing needs and I hope to keep it that way for myself and for others. :)

I also have a formal qualification in Computer Science from the [Institution of Engineers (India)], and a valid [GATE] 2017 score.
